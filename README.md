# Object-detection
This project uses OpenCV and MobileNet for real-time object detection, specifically classifying waste like plastic. Detected waste objects are highlighted with red bounding boxes, and adjustable confidence thresholds improve detection accuracy. Suitable for environmental monitoring.
